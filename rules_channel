***READ THE COMMANDMENTS***

**1.** Do not question the legitimacy of my regime :tired_face:
**2.** We expect everyone here to follow the Discord Terms of Service :yum:
**3.** ***This is a Christian server.***
> *a. We are, by a significant majority, Christian and Socially Conservative and expect the content in the server to reflect those values.*
> *b. God's revealed nature is His Love. That love is characterized as Charity toward God and toward others. We do not practice tolerance here, we practice Charity*
> *c. Non-Christian views will be gladly heard and discussed here, but not to the detriment of our God.*
**4. **This is a High Energy server, your weakness embarrasses us.
**5.** Do not record text or voice chat. Working for the FBI, CIA, NSA, DHS, ATF, ABC, CNN, OR MI6 is cringe.
**6.** This is a Members-only server, those who are not members or who are no longer members will be removed from the server by the Admins of Heck of Connie!
**7.** No simping, no whores.
**8.** No doxxing.
**9.** No advertising
**10.** Multiple accounts, fake accounts, IP spoofing, and all attempts to get onto the server without approval will be met with extreme prejudice. If you are a problem user, you will be warned and then if persistent, kicked.

**Bannable offenses may include, but are not necessarily limited to: nazism, anti-Semitism, use of racial slurs, harassment, being cringe, spam, degenerate behavior, and being a pain for the mods.**
