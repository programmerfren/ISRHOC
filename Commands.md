| Command                       | Description                                                  | Users              |

| `.hash <email address>`       | Only works in @BasedCounter DMs, generates a *SHA256* hash string from an email address | Migrants/New Joins |
| `.verify <hash>`              | Uses generated hash string to find user's email address in the HOC subscription database | Migrants/New Joins |
| `.resetUser <@member>`        | Resets a user to Migrant role                                | Intelligentsia     |
| `.accept <@member>`           | Used after voice verification to accept new member into the server, gives Comrade role and removes previous roles | Intelligentsia     |
| `.prune`                      | Used to go through the member list and "de-comrade" anyone who is not actively subscribed to the website. These people, at staff discretion, may only need to re-subscribe without a second voice interview to get back in. A to-be-created bot command will eventually be able to tell whether a user's discord account is linked in the database already or not to help with that. | Stormtroopers      |
